# Belly Button Challenge

### Overview:
We have been given the Belly Button Biodiversity data, which presents microbes present in a majority of humans, located on the following website:
http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

### Goal:
Create an interactive dashboard from the data set.

Step 1: Use the D3 library to read in the json from the following URL: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. I was able to console.log the data and see the data we are working with. I have commented other codes to see how I was able to get the to data needed to create the horizantal bar chart.
